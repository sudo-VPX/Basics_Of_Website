# In Short Conclusion 


- If You want to Add Our Code In External Style , Script then You May Need To Add The Licence x Number Of Time the File You Taken , May Independent of if You Choose one file copy many times then just One Licence Required , For 2 different files then 2 Licence 

- If You Want Internal Style , Script Then Add Licence AT Top Of Their Starting Tag , Means Inside ```<Style> Licence <Style/>``` for Css , Inside ```<Script> Licence <Script/>``` For JS


# End 

- Thank You , If You Don't Want This Licence Mess In Your Code then Just Invest As Minimal As  ₹ 10 in ``` FerroFy ```
